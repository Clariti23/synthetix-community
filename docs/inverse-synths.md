The team has a <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/inverse-synths-are-back/#how-inverse-synths-work-" class="link" target="_blank">good explanation</a> of how inverse synths work. They trade in a range with an upper and lower limit and, if limits are breached by the real-world asset, the synth is disabled, the positions are liquidated. At some point after, the team will deploy a new version of the inverse synth with new upper and lower bounds.
