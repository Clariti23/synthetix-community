## Intro
Staking is the process that converts the SNX token into pooled collateral for the network. When an investor stakes their tokens, they're `minting` sUSD to be used to trade for synthetic assets, whether by the staker or another investor. The staker can trade the sUSD for a synthetic asset on <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://synthetix.exchange/">Synthetix Exchange</a> or exchange it for ETH or another ERC20 token on a variety of exchanges.


## Why stake?
Stakers earn weekly rewards for collateralizing the network. Without staking, an SNX investor can only profit from an increase in the price of the token. As of November 2019, about 80% of SNX tokens are staked. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.synthetix.io/">Synthetix Dashboard</a> has up-to-date stats on the network, including the percentage of staked tokens. 

## Who can stake?
Anyone who holds the SNX token. That said, if a staker holds less than 250-500 SNX, gas costs may exceed the benefit of staking rewards.
